# Agent QA

Agent QA is a testing framework designed specifically for AI agents. It provides a structured way to test your AI agent's behavior through YAML-based scenarios with powerful assertions.

## Key Features

- **YAML-based scenarios** - Write tests in a declarative format
- **Database assertions** - Verify entities were created/updated correctly
- **Tool call assertions** - Validate which tools were called and how many times
- **Response assertions** - Check agent responses for expected content
- **Token usage tracking** - Monitor and assert on token consumption
- **Traces integration** - Capture and analyze execution traces

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @agent-qa/core
```

Create a configuration file `agentqa.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@agent-qa/core';

export default defineConfig({
  name: 'MyAgent',
  agent: {
    baseUrl: '$API_URL',
    token: '$API_TOKEN',
  },
});
```

Write your first scenario in `scenarios/suite.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Basic Tests
scenarios:
  - id: greeting
    name: Agent responds to greeting
    steps:
      - chat: "Hello!"
        response:
          contains: ["hello", "hi"]
```

Run your tests:

```bash
npx agentqa run scenarios/suite.yaml
```
